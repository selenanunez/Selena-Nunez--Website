        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Selena Nunez. Currently I am a first year at the University of California, Riverside pursuing a Bachelors of Arts in Sociology and Administrative Studies. While at UCR I hope to get involved in many different organizations on campus. Currently Iâ€™m involved in a sorority in which I have the opportunity to network with hundreds of women. My goal is to graduate in three years. In the next few years I plan to focus on doing multiple internships which will help me gain necessary experiences. Not only will these experiences help make me more suitable for my desired career but also help me stand out in my Graduate applications. Post undergrad I plan on attending Law school in order to enter into the field of Family Law.  <br><br>

        A little bit about myself would be that not only am I an animal lover but also a people person. In my free time I enjoy watching movies, going on hikes, and travelling. Currently I volunteer at the Lighthouse School for the blind. Previously Iâ€™ve spent a lot of my time at my local animal shelter as well as mentoring elementary school students. Through my mentoring I was able to gain a lot of hands on experience with the children in my community. This helped me in becoming more self-aware of the prominent issues often times ignored in smaller disadvantaged communities. Because of many of these experiences and my own growing up I chose a career path focusing on Social Welfare and individualâ€™s wellbeing. I enjoy working closely with communities and believe even the smallest contributions can have a greater impact on individuals and their families. Iâ€™ve always had an interest for the general welfare of all communities especially those underprivileged. Within the next year or two I plan on volunteering in Thailand to work with children of underprivileged communities. Through this not only will I tutor them and help ensure they are caught up in the appropriate material but also help bring their spirit up. Many children are forced to experience different hardships that result in their broken spirits and belief that it is impossible for them to obtain anything better than what they already have, this is something I would want to change.<br><br>

        Part of what has played a major role in my interests and career choice are my family background. I come from a family of immigrants. Growing up I lived in a very poor and underprivileged community. Seeing the way certain factors largely hinder the opportunities one has pushed me to want to have some direct influence or impact on these individuals. Growing up in single parent households can also greatly influence a childâ€™s experiences and overall development. Stressors at home for either individuals leads to the need of prioritizing certain things because theyâ€™re most necessary not exactly beneficial.
